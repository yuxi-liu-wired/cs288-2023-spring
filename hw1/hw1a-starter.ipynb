The purpose of this first assignment is to make sure that you are familiar with all the tools you need to complete the programming assignments for the course.  We will walk you through the process of building a model with PyTorch in Kaggle.  Most of it will be structured as a tutorial, but we will ask you to fill in code and submit at the end. \n\nPlease note that this assignment is not representative of the projects for this course - other projects will be considerably more involved and take longer to complete.\n\nOur assignments will be given to you as Jupyter notebooks, and we intend for you to run them using Kaggle or Google Colab. Kaggle has historically had better availability of GPUs so we recommend using Kaggle.\n\n### Kaggle\nFirst go to https://www.kaggle.com/ and create an account. Click `Create` on the top right click `Copy & Edit` the notebook.\n\nTo access a GPU, first verify your phone number. Then, click the three dots on the right and `Accelerator` in the drop down and select a GPU.\n\n### Colab\nTo get started, make a copy of the assignment by clicking `File->Save a copy in drive...`.  You will need to be logged into a Google account, such as your @berkeley.edu account.\n\nTo access a GPU, go to `Edit->Notebook settings` and in the `Hardware accelerator` dropdown choose `GPU`. \nAs soon as you run a code cell, you will be connected to a cloud instance with a GPU.\n\n\nTry running the code cell below to check that a GPU is connected (select the cell then either click the play button at the top left or press `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter`).","metadata":{"id":"gtKllKL-EFgx"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\n\nif torch.cuda.is_available():\n    print('Found GPU')\nelse:\n    print('Did not find GPU')","metadata":{"id":"82H_i6foD8A_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1611952535610,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":3962,"user":{"displayName":"Rudy Corona Rodriguez","photoUrl":"","userId":"02448394073714905143"}},"outputId":"3d13ba10-8e5f-4027-c706-bbb746229a21","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-01-26T00:21:39.107826Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-01-26T00:21:39.108333Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-01-26T00:21:41.236400Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-01-26T00:21:39.108226Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-01-26T00:21:41.235086Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Did not find GPU\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note for Colab users: When you run a code cell, Colab executes it on a temporary cloud instance.  Every time you open the notebook, you will be assigned a different machine.  All compute state and files saved on the previous machine will be lost.  Therefore, you may need to re-download datasets or rerun code after a reset. If you save output files that you don't want to lose, you should download them to your personal computer before moving on to something else. You can download files by hitting the > arrow at the top left of the page under the menus to expand the sidebar, selecting `Files`, right clicking the file you want, and clicking `Download`.  Alternatively, you can mount your Google drive to the temporary cloud instance's local filesystem using the following code snippet and save files under the specified directory (note that you will have to provide permission every time you run this).\n","metadata":{"id":"_GJMaS91RICk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# You can delete this cell if you are using Kaggle.\n# mount Google drive\nfrom google.colab import drive\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\n\n# now you can see files\n!echo -e \"\\nNumber of Google drive files in /content/drive/My Drive/:\"\n!ls -l \"/content/drive/My Drive/\" | wc -l\n# by the way, you can run any linux command by putting a ! at the start of the line\n\n# by default everything gets executed and saved in /content/\n!echo -e \"\\nCurrent directory:\"\n!pwd","metadata":{"id":"1et0WnGSVUD_","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1611814775203,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":4024,"user":{"displayName":"Rudy Corona Rodriguez","photoUrl":"","userId":"02448394073714905143"}},"outputId":"f822d139-522e-441d-ee9a-7d09050af1d1","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Many of the assignments will require training a model for some period of time, often on the order of 20-30 minutes.  There are some important limitations to Colab that you should be aware of when running code for this amount of time.  If you close the window or put your computer to sleep, Colab will disconnect you from the compute machine and your code will stop running.   There are also timeouts for inactivity (somewhere on the order of 30 minutes), so if you want to leave code running, be sure to check back periodically.  After a timeout, your compute machine will be disconnected and the files on it will be lost.\n\nA few other notes about using Colab:\n* The `Runtime` menu has many different run options, such as `Run all` or `Run after` so you don't have to run each code block individually.\n* Some people have run into CUDA device assert errors that did not originate from their code.  Restarting the runtime should fix this (unless there actually is a problem with your code).\n\nIf at some point you want to run longer jobs or connect to multiple GPUs, there are coupons for Google Compute Cloud available for students in the course. You could deploy your own cloud instance and run JupyterHub to recreate a similar environment to Colab. However, the course staff cannot offer technical support for this kind of configuration; you're on your own to set it up.","metadata":{"id":"sFp3VopnW3lZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Part-of-Speech Tagging\n\nYou'll be trying to predict the most common [part of speech](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/8.pdf) for a word from its characters.  This project will focus on word types rather than tokens and not use any context (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93token_distinction). This task is different from (and simpler than) a standard part-of-speech tagging task, which predicts part-of-speech tags for tokens in their sentential context.\n\nMany words can have multiple different parts of speech, but in this project we will associate each word only with its most common part of speech in the [Brown Corpus](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/w3c/corpus_ling/content/corpora/list/private/brown/brown.html), which has been manually labeled with part-of-speech tags.  \n\nWords are lowercased and filtered for length and frequency. Punctuation and numbers are removed. Any real NLP application would have to deal with the actual contents of text instead of filtering in this way, but we're just warming up.\n\nBelow, we provide you with code to load the dataset.

You should have received an email with instructions to get added to Gradescope.

For this project, your submission will contain:\n* hw1a.ipynb\n* predicted_test_outputs_pooling.txt\n* predicted_test_outputs_improved.txt\n\nYou can upload files individually or as part of a zip file, but if using a zip file be sure you are zipping the files directly and not a folder that contains them.\n \nTo download this notebook, go to `File->Download .ipynb`.  Please rename the file to match the name in our file list.  You can download other outputs, like `predicted_test_output_improved.txt` by clicking the > arrow near the top left and finding it under `Files`.\n\nWhen submitting your ipython notebooks, make sure everything runs correctly if the cells are executed in order starting from a fresh session.  Note that just because a cell runs in your current session doesn't mean it doesn't rely on code that you have already changed or deleted.  If the code doesn't take too long to run, we recommend re-running everything with `Runtime->Restart and run all...`.\n\nWhen you upload your submission to the Gradescope assignment, you should get immediate feedback that confirms your submission was processed correctly.  Be sure to check this, as an incorrectly formatted submission could cause the autograder to fail.  For this project, you should be able to see your test set accuracies and a confirmation that all required files were found, but you will not be able to see your score until later.  Most assignments will be graded primarily on your test set accuracies, but we may also use other factors to grade.\n\nNote that Gradesope will allow you to submit multiple times before the deadline, and we will use the latest submission for grading.","metadata":{"id":"uO7Ku-YUSc0D"}}]}
