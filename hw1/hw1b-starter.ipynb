To properly deal with this input format, you should save the last state of the LSTM from a batch to feed in as the first state of the next batch.  When you save state across different batches, you should call `.detach()` on the state tensors before the next batch to tell PyTorch not to backpropagate gradients through the state into the batch you have already finished (which will cause a runtime error).\n\nWe expect your model to reach a validation perplexity below 130.  The following architecture and hyperparameters should be sufficient to get there.\n* 3 LSTM layers with 512 units\n* dropout of 0.5 after each LSTM layer\n* instead of projecting directly from the last LSTM output to the vocabulary size for softmax, project down to a smaller size first (e.g. 512->128->vocab_size). **NOTE: You may find that adding nonlinearities between these layers can hurt performance, try without first.**\n* use the same weights for the embedding layer and the pre-softmax layer; dimension 128\n* train with Adam (using default learning rates) for at least 20 epochs\n","metadata":{"id":"qOp1Gb_0WjlE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"class LSTMNetwork(nn.Module):\n    # a PyTorch Module that holds the neural network for your model\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        # YOUR CODE HERE\n\n\n    def forward(self, x, state):\n        \"\"\"Compute the output of the network.\n        \n        Note: In the Pytorch LSTM tutorial, the state variable is named \"hidden\":\n        https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/sequence_models_tutorial.html\n\n        The torch.nn.LSTM documentation is quite helpful:\n        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#lstm\n    \n        x - a tensor of int64 inputs with shape (seq_len, batch)\n        state - a tuple of two tensors with shape (num_layers, batch, hidden_size)\n                representing the hidden state and cell state of the of the LSTM.\n        returns a tuple with two elements:\n          - a tensor of log probabilities with shape (seq_len, batch, vocab_size)\n          - a state tuple returned by applying the LSTM.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Note that the nn.LSTM module expects inputs with the sequence \n        # dimension before the batch by default.\n        # In this case the dimensions are already in the right order, \n        # but watch out for this since sometimes people put the batch first\n\n        # YOUR CODE HERE\n\n\nclass LSTMModel:\n    \"A class that wraps LSTMNetwork to handle training and evaluation.\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.network = LSTMNetwork().cuda()\n\n    def train(self):\n        train_iterator = data.BPTTIterator(train_dataset, batch_size=64, \n                                                     bptt_len=32, device='cuda')\n        # Iterate over train_iterator with a for loop to get batches\n        # each batch object has a .text and .target attribute with\n        # token id tensors for the input and output respectively.\n\n        # The initial state passed into the LSTM should be set to zero.\n\n        # YOUR CODE HERE\n\n\n    def next_word_probabilities(self, text_prefix):\n        \"Return a list of probabilities for each word in the vocabulary.\"\n\n        prefix_token_tensor = torch.tensor(ids(text_prefix), device='cuda').view(-1, 1)\n        \n        # YOUR CODE HERE\n\n\n\n    def dataset_perplexity(self, torchtext_dataset):\n        \"Return perplexity as a float.\"\n        # Your code should be very similar to next_word_probabilities, but\n        # run in a loop over batches.

Try to reach a validation perplexity below 120. You may either modify the LSTM class above, or copy it down to the code cell below and modify it there. Just **be sure to run code cell below to generate results with your improved LSTM**.  \n\nIt is okay if the bulk of your improvements are due to hyperparameter tuning (such as changing number or sizes of layers), but implement at least one more substantial change to the model.  Here are some ideas (several of which come from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf):\n* activation regularization - add a l2 regularization penalty on the activation of the LSTM output (standard l2 regularization is on the weights)\n* weight-drop regularization - apply dropout to the weight matrices instead of activations\n* learning rate scheduling - decrease the learning rate during training\n* embedding dropout - zero out the entire embedding for a random set of words in the embedding matrix\n* ensembling - average the predictions of several models trained with different initialization random seeds\n* temporal activation regularization - add l2 regularization on the difference between the LSTM output activations at adjacent timesteps\n\nYou may notice that most of these suggestions are regularization techniques.  This dataset is considered fairly small, so regularization is one of the best ways to improve performance.\n\nFor this section, you will submit a write-up describing the extensions and/or modifications that you tried.  Your write-up should be **1-page maximum** in length and should be submitted in PDF format.  You may use any editor you like, but we recommend using LaTeX and working in an environment like Overleaf.\nFor full credit, your write-up should include:\n1.   A concise and precise description of the extension that you tried.\n2.   A motivation for why you believed this approach might improve your model.\n3.   A discussion of whether the extension was effective and/or an analysis of the results.  This will generally involve some combination of tables, learning curves, etc.\n4.
